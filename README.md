# The Chcuk Norris app
This app gets a Chuck Norris Joke from an API and displays it to the user.
To be honest the jokes are not that funny, but I wasn't willing to pay for the api that came with funny ones.

# Development enviroment
Android studio is a pretty straight forward development enviroment. It's a little bit of a hefty download, but essentially plug and play. I'm really impressed with how they've managed the buid tools for java.
to run it you just plug in a physical device with debugging enabled or run it in a virtual device by click the build and run button.

Screenshots of the app running are included in the repository.

The Android Studio Docs were what I used to implement the program, along with a healthy dose of stack overflow searching to get the java sytax right.
